\section{Alternative endpoints}
\subsection{PC50 and PC99}
\subsubsection*{PC50}
PC50 was estimated by log-linear interpolation. The PC50 clearance times thus obtained are plotted in Figure \ref{pc50anova} by experimental factors with sub-plots to look for interactions.
\begin{figure}[p]

\caption{Comparison of PC50 main effects and interactions with $t$ distribution 95\% confidence intervals for the means}
\label{pc50anova}
\end{figure}
A similar pattern can be seen as for PC90 (Figures \ref{pc90boxes} and \ref{pc90interaction} on pages \pageref{pc90boxes} and \pageref{pc90interaction}). The same key features are present namely
\begin{itemize}
\item No difference between centres.
\item A reduction in clearance time with the combined treatment, but only for female subjects.
\item A greater variance for subjects on the single (``alone'') treatment.
\end{itemize}

The same procedure of inspecting the distribution of standardized residuals was followed for choosing an appropriate ANOVA model for the data. As with PC90 it was found that the most suitable model for the PC50 clearance time was a 2-way ANOVA model by sex and treatment with a square-root transformation of the dependent variable, fitted by weighted least-squares, using the variances of the two treatment groups as the weighting. The results are shown in Table \ref{aov50}.

Although Figure \ref{pc50anova} seems to show a sex-treatment interaction effect on clearance times we do not have evidence at the 5\% level to reject the hypothesis that there is no effect of sex or treatment. This is probably because the difference between clearance times is smaller than for PC90 and we don't have enough data to detect this difference at the 5\% level.

The mean PC50 clearance times and confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{inference50}.
\begin{table}[h]

Female, combined treatment	& 2:54 & (0:54, 6:03) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For female subjects the mean decrease in PC50 in the combined treatment group over the single treatment group is 7.1 hours with a 95\% confidence interval of (0.7, 9.9) hours.

\subsubsection*{PC99}
The log-linear interpolated PC99 values are plotted in Figure \ref{pc99anova}.
\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{pc99anova.eps} 
\caption{Comparison of PC99 main effects and interactions with $t$ distribution 95\% confidence intervals for the means}
\label{pc99anova}
\end{figure}
For 3 subjects the parasite count did not reach the PC99 level by the end of the study, hence there is only PC99 data for 40 out of the 43 subjects. Once again there is no discernible effect of centre or sex alone on the clearance times. However, now the improvement of the combined treatment over the single treatment seems more symmetrical between sexes. Results of 2-way ANOVA by sex and treatment on the square-root transformed clearance times fitted by treatment-weighted least-squares are shown in Table \ref{aov99}.
%              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)   
%Sex            1  1.436   1.436  1.4664 0.233808

\end{table}

It can be seen that there is evidence to reject the hypothesis that treatment has no effect on PC99 clearance time, but no evidence to reject the hypothesis that sex has no effect. Therefore, we can exclude sex as a factor and refit a 1-way ANOVA model by treatment alone, giving the results shown in Table \ref{aov99r}.
%            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)   
%Treatment    1  9.396   9.396  9.3959 0.00399 **

\hline
Total&47.40&39&&&
\end{tabular}\\
**$<0.005$
\end{table}

The mean PC99 clearance time for patients on the single treatment is 21:07 (hrs:mins) with a 95\% confidence interval of (16:12, 26:41); for the combined treatment it is 12:33 (9:53, 15:32). This gives a mean decrease in PC99 for subjects on the combined treatment over the single treatment of 9.3 hours with a 95\% confidence interval of (3.7, 15.0) hours.

\subsection{Parasite reduction ratios}
Another endpoint used in studies of the efficacy of antimalarial drugs is the \emph{Parasite Reduction Ratio}, which is the ratio of the pre-dose parasite count to the count at a specific time from the time of first dose. 48 hours is often chosen as a time to calculate this ratio (PRR48) as this represents the reduction in parasites over a single life-cycle of the parasites\cite{white}. ``PRR24'', The reduction over 24 hours is also used\cite{newton}.

PRR48 measurements are not available for our data as the parasite count is 0 by 48 hours for all but 6 subjects. Even after 24 hours there are only 25 of the 43 subjects with non-zero parasite counts. After 12 hours though there are still 37 of the 43 subjects with a non-zero parasite count so we can look at PRR12 and have reasonable numbers in groups to make comparisons between treatments. The log parasite reduction ratio after 12 hours is shown in Figure \ref{prr12}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{prr12.eps} 
\caption{log PRR12 with 95\% confidence intervals for the means}
\label{prr12}
\end{figure}

A similar pattern as with the PC90 and PC50 endpoints can be seen in that the treatment only seems to be effective among female patients in increasing PRR. It was found that a logarithmic transformation was appropriate for 2-way ANOVA modelling of the PRR12 data giving the results shown in Table \ref{aovprr12}.
%              Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)  
%Sex            1   1.524   1.524  0.2725 0.60512  
%Treatment      1  21.265  21.265  3.8024 0.05972 .
%Sex:Treatment  1  15.951  15.951  2.8521 0.10069  
%Residuals     33 184.557   5.593          
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{ANOVA table for PC99 model}\label{aovprr12}
\begin{tabular}{l|rrrrrl}
Source&Sum Sq.&df&Mean Sq.&$F$&P($>F$)\\
\hline
$Sex$				& 1.52 & 1 & 1.52 & 0.273 & 0.605 & \\
$Treatment$			& 21.27   & 1 & 21.27   & 3.80 & 0.060 & \\
$Sex\times Treatment$	& 15.95   & 1 & 15.95   & 2.85   & 0.101 & \\
$Residuals$			& 184.56 & 33 & 5.59 &&&\\
\hline
Total&223.30&36&&&
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It can be seen that there is some evidence between the 5 and 10\% level to reject the hypothesis that the treatment has no effect on the parasite reduction ratio after 12 hours. It may be that we don't have enough data to detect the treatment effect observed in Figure \ref{prr12}. The model gives a mean increase in PRR12 for subjects on the combined treatment over those on the single treatment of 25.5 with a 95\% confidence interval of (-0.4, 159.8).

\section{Functional data analysis}
\subsection{Overview of functional data analysis}
Functional data analysis (FDA) is a relatively new technique whereby the data is analysed in terms of smooth functions. An example is longitudinal data such as the growth of children or the weather over a year\cite{ramsay}. With such data we describe the response with a smooth function and then look at the ways the characteristics of the function change between cases. For example, this type of analysis can make use of derivatives of the functions to look for patterns in rates of change. Functional data analysis is somewhat analogous to multivariate data analysis, looking at multiple responses and characteristic combinations of responses between cases.

The parasite count data in this study is a good candidate for functional data analysis in that the response for each replicate of experimental factors centre, sex and treatment can be described as a smooth function of parasite count with time. We already used cubic and logistic functions in order to extract a single response variable, the PC90 clearance time, but now we can go on to explore the nature of a functional response.

Many familiar statistical summaries and techniques have functional equivalents. Means and standard deviations can be expressed as mean functions and standard deviation functions for example. Regression and ANOVA can be performed with functional dependent and independent variables yielding residual, $F$ statistic and coefficient functions.
\subsection{Basis functions}
The first step in FDA is to identify an appropriate smoothing function for our data known as a \emph{basis function}. For periodic data fourier functions are normally used, for non-periodic data the most commonly used basis functions are cubic splines\cite{fdaweb}. Fitting a cubic spline requires choice of \emph{breakpoints} between which we fit cubic polynomials. The simplest choice of breakpoints with longitudinal data is to choose the times at which the data were taken. We also specify a smoothness parameter that limits the size of higher derivatives and hence the sharpness of the curve.

\subsubsection*{Fitting a basis function to the parasite count data}

We want to compare the development of parasite count with time between subjects using a scale that is independent of the absolute count. Hence we will use the fraction of the pre-dose parasite count. We determined that a logarithmic transform of the count is appropriate for this data and hence we will use as our time-dependent variable $y(t)$
$$y(t)=\log (1+P(t))-\log(1+P_{0})$$
which is the logarithm of the ratio of the parasite count at time $t$, $P(t)$, to the pre-dose parasite count $P_{0}$. 1 is added to both so that the logarithm of 0 count is 0.

Ramsay \textit{et al.} have written a \emph{R} package, \texttt{fda}\cite{fdaR, fdaRbook} for functional data analysis. The functions in this package were used to fit cubic splines to the data. The level of smoothing is determined by penalising derivatives of the spline function. It was found that penalising the 2nd derivative (the rate of change of slope) by a factor of 10 gave reasonable smoothing such that the fitted curves were insensitive to small-scale (perhaps random-error scale) variation but described the overall trend of the parasite count well. The resulting curves for the 43 subjects are shown in Figure \ref{cubicspline}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{cubicspline.eps} 
\caption{Cubic splines fitted to the parasite count, smoothed by penalising the 2nd derivative}
\label{cubicspline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Functional ANOVA}
Once we have suitably represented our dependent data as a functional response we can perform ANOVA by sex and treatment in an analogous way to the previous analyses. The model now becomes
\begin{equation}
y_{jkl}(t)=\mu(t)+S_{j}(t)+T_{k}(t)+(ST)_{jk}(t)+\epsilon_{jkl}(t)\quad\quad\epsilon\sim N(0, \sigma^{2}(t))\label{aovfda}
\end{equation}
where each part of the model is now a function of time. Hence, we will have 43 residual functions, a mean function for the overall mean with time, $\mu(t)$, a function for the effect of sex, $S(t)$, and for the effect of treatment, $T(t)$.

The standardized residuals ($e_{jkl}(t)/\hat{\sigma}(t)$) from fitting this model are shown in Figures \ref{fdaresids} and \ref{fdahistqq}. It can be seen that they are approximately normally distributed about 0 indicating that our parameter function estimates will be unbiased.
\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{fdaresids.eps} 
\caption{Standardized residual functions for 2-way functional ANOVA}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{fdahistqq.eps} 
\caption{Distribution of standardized residuals for 2-way functional ANOVA}
\label{fdahistqq}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{fda} library provides functions for deriving a permutation $F$ test similar to the methods used in section \ref{section:resampling}. The results of this permutation $F$ test for our 2-way ANOVA are shown in Figure \ref{fdapermF}. It can be seen that the null hypothesis of no difference of sex or treatment groups is not rejected up to 10 hours from first dose, then there is evidence after 10 hours to reject the null hypothesis, with no evidence for rejection after about 30 hours. This can be explained by the parasite count being independent of sex and treatment allocation at the start, with significant differences in the count trajectories developing between the groups as time goes on, with them eventually returning to parity as clearance is finally achieved for all subjects.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{fdapermF.eps} 
\caption{$F$ statistic function for 2-way functional ANOVA}
\label{fdapermF}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fdcoef} shows the fitted coefficient functions.
\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{fdcoef.eps} 
\caption{Fitted coefficient functions for 2-way ANOVA model \ref{aovfda} (page \pageref{aovfda}). From top-left, to bottom-right, the functions are $\mu(t)$, $S(t)$, $T(t)$, $ST(t)$.}
\label{fdcoef}
\end{figure}
 The top-left panel shows the mean $\mu$ corresponding to male subjects on the single treatment with the other panels showing the deviation from this mean due to sex, treatment and the interaction of sex and treatment respectively. We can see that there is no evidence at the 5\% level over the whole time period to reject the hypothesis that sex has no effect. Between approximately 17 and 45 hours there is evidence to reject the hypothesis that treatment has no effect and between 10 and 15 hours there is evidence to reject the hypothesis that there is no interaction between sex and treatment that effects the clearance.
 
Figure \ref{fdfitted} shows the fitted mean-level functions with 95\% confidence intervals\footnote{The routines for calculating the standard errors and confidence intervals of predicted functions are not yet implemented in the \emph{R} \texttt{fda} library, hence it was necessary to implement these. The code is in Appendix X}.
\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=150mm]{lprr2i.eps} 
\caption{Fitted count-ratio functions with confidence intervals}
\label{fdfitted}
\end{figure}
It can be seen that the difference between male subjects on the alone and combined drug treatment becomes large (relative to their 95\% confidence limits) between 20 and 30 hours reflecting the treatment effect shown in Figure \ref{fdcoef} between 20 and 30 hours. The difference between treatments for female subjects is larger between 10 and 30 hours reflecting the combined effect of treatment and the sex-treatment interaction: the effect is essentially an addition of the bottom two panels in Figure \ref{fdcoef}. With reference to the 95\% confidence intervals, there is good evidence to reject the hypothesis that these observations are artifacts of random variation and that there is no effect of sex and treatment. The $F$ test in Figure \ref{fdapermF} is a more formal evaluation of this evidence.
