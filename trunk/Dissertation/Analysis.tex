\subsection{PC90 ANOVA} 
3-way ANOVA with interactions was performed on the PC90 data over centre, sex and treatment. The results are shown in Table \ref{anova}. It can be seen that the only significant effect on PC90 is the treatment used (\texttt{trt}), with perhaps some effect of the interaction between sex and treatment. This is a result we might expect. If we fit a model with treatment as the only factor we find that treatment B reduces the PC90 time compared to treatment A by 8.0 hours with a 95\% confidence interval of (1.9, 14.1) hours.

Diagnostic plots of the residuals of the ANOVA model are shown in Figure \ref{resid}. There does not seem to be any significant departure from normality in the distribution of residuals which suggests that we may not need a transformation for modelling the PC90 data. However, there is perhaps some evidence of heteroskedasticity in that the variance of the residuals appears to increase with increasing fitted PC90 value, hence we may need a variance-stabalising transformation.
