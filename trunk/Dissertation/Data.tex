\section{Data description}
The data were received as an email attachment from our contact at Glaxo Smithkline. The attachment was a SAS data set which was able to be read into R by first exporting from SAS in dbf format and then read into R using the \texttt{read.dbf} function.
Table \ref{rdata} shows the data as an R data frame.

The columns are:
\begin{itemize}
\item\texttt{CENTREID} - The centre at which the study was undertaken, eithe centre '001' or '002'.
\item\texttt{SUBJID} - An identifier for each subject (patient) participating in the trial. There are 43 subjects.
\item\texttt{SEX} - The sex of each subject, either 'M' or 'F'.
\item\texttt{plantm} - The planned time of taking a blood sample for measuring parasite load, either 'PRE-DOSE' i.e. before the drug treatment is administered, or 'n HOURS AFTER FIRST DOSE'.
\item\texttt{acttm} - The actual time in hours that the blood sample was taken relative to the time the treatment was administered, hence all pre-dose times are negative.
\item\texttt{parct} - The parasite count per $\mu L$ of blood.
\item\texttt{trt} - An indicator of which treatment was used 'A' or 'B'.
\item\texttt{trttxt} - A description of treatments 'A' and 'B', namely 'alone', meaning that a single drug was used or 'combi' meaning that a combination treatment was used.

\subsection{The Parasite Count}
One of the first questions addressed was whether the parasite count is a true count, and thus Poission statistics would be applicable, or whether it is a derived measurement. Our contact informed us that the method used to arrive at the \texttt{parct} values was that a microscopist would count a chosen area of a slide of blood, counting parasites ($N_p$) and white blood cells ($N_w$). The number of white blood cells in a $\mu L$ of blood ($\rho_w$) is automatically counted by a machine. Accordingly the number of parasites in a $\mu L$ of blood (\texttt{parct}) is given by:
$$\mathtt{parct}=\frac{N_p}{N_w}\rho_w$$
and thus we cannot treat this derived measurement as a count for modelling purposes.

We were also informed that the white blood cell count is right skewed and so we might expect that the parasite count per $\mu L$ will be also. Table \ref{predose} shows the pre-treatment parasite counts in the subjects from each test centre and of each sex. The $M^*$ row for centre 002 is where one large outlying value of 196029 has been removed. It can be seen that for 3 cases the mean is larger than the median meaning that the distributions are right skewed. This is to be expected for non-negative data such as this. When model fitting to this data we may have to choose some transformation of the parasite count such as taking logarithms.

\section{Preliminary Analysis}
\subsection{Deriving PC90}
The project specification says that the endpoint of primary importance is PC90, the time to achieve a reduction of the parasitaemia by 90\% of baseline level. As a first attempt at deriving estimates of PC90 from the data, simple linear polynomial fits to the logarithm of the parasite count with time from first dose were investigated (actually log(1+parct)).

It was found that a cubic was the most suitable model if we include the data only up to the first 0 parasite count. For some patients where the parasite count drops quickly to 0. A fit that includes the subsequent run of 0s would pull the cubic fit away from the most sensible estimate of PC90. It is more suitable for the purpose of estimating PC90 to only model the drop in the count to 0 using a simple cubic model. 

Figure \ref{cubics} shows the cubic fits to the log parasite count for the 43 subjects treated. The horizontal dotted line on the plots shows the PC90 level i.e. where the parasite count has fallen to 10\% of its initial value. The value of PC90 i.e. the time t at which the parasite count has fallen to 10\% was found by least-squares i.e. using the \texttt{optimize} function in R to minimise:
$$[log(1+0.1P_0)-\beta_0-\beta_1t-\beta_2t^2-\beta_3t^3]^2$$
where $P_0$ is the pre-treatment parasite count, $t$ is the time from first dose and $\beta_i$ are the fitted coefficients for the models for each of the 43 patients. Table \ref{pc90} shows the values of PC90 derived from the cubic fit to the parasite count by centre, sex and treatment.

\subsection{PC90 ANOVA} 
3-way ANOVA with interactions was performed on the PC90 data over centre, sex and treatment. The results are shown in Table \ref{anova}. It can be seen that the only significant effect on PC90 is the treatment used (\texttt{trt}), with perhaps some effect of the interaction between sex and treatment. This is a result we might expect. If we fit a model with treatment as the only factor we find that treatment B reduces the PC90 time compared to treatment A by 8.0 hours with a 95\% confidence interval of (1.9, 14.1) hours.

Diagnostic plots of the residuals of the ANOVA model are shown in Figure \ref{resid}. There does not seem to be any significant departure from normality in the distribution of residuals which suggests that we may not need a transformation for modelling the PC90 data. However, there is perhaps some evidence of heteroskedasticity in that the variance of the residuals appears to increase with increasing fitted PC90 value, hence we may need a variance-stabalising transformation.

\section{Work Plan}
The next stages of the analysis are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Look in more detail at deriving the PC90 estimates. Logistic regression has been suggested in the project outline which would require non-linear regression techniques.
\item Look at how to identify and deal with suspicious outliers in the parasite count data and how they influence our estimates of PC90.
\item Incorporate the error in PC90 estimates into the modelling of treatment effect.
\end{itemize}
