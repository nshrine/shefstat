  abstract = {The therapeutic responses to the eight most widely used antimalarial
	drugs were assessed in 207 adult patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria.
	This parasite does not cause marked sequestration, so parasite clearance
	can be used as a direct measure of antimalarial activity. The activities
	of these drugs in descending order were artesunate, artemether, chloroquine,
	mefloquine, quinine, halofantrine, primaquine, and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine
	(PS). Therapeutic responses to PS were poor; parasitemias did not
	clear in 5 of the 12 PS-treated patients, whereas all the other patients
	made an initial recovery. Of 166 patients monitored for [&gt;=]28
	days, 35% had reappearance of vivax malaria 11 to 65 days later and
	7% developed falciparum malaria 5 to 21 days after the start of treatment.
	There were no significant differences in the times taken for vivax
	malaria reappearance among the different groups except for those
	given mefloquine and chloroquine, in which all vivax malaria reappearances
	developed >28 days after treatment, suggesting suppression of the
	first relapse by these slowly eliminated drugs. There was no evidence
	of chloroquine resistance. The antimalarial drugs vary considerably
	in their intrinsic activities and stage specificities of action.},
